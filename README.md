# REI Analyze: React 

This is the first large web app I've decided to create. It's about 40-50% complete. And was bootstrapped with create-react-app.

Note: This is just the front-end code for the project, all of the handling of login, search, etc. can be found in [rei-analyze-api](https://github.com/jmorales2718/rei-analyze-api).
